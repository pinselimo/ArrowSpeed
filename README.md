# Arrow Speed

A Garmin data field that provides arrows indicating if the current speed is above or below the current average speed.

These arrows are famously found on bicycle computers of another brand named after the greek letter $\sigma$. Ever since I switched to Garmin I missed this small detail, so I went ahead and recreated it.
